# Password Generator

For this home assignment, I was tasked with creating a password generator.

<h2>The following is the list of criteria for the password generator:</h2>

    * GIVEN I need a new, secure password
    * WHEN I click the button to generate a password
    * THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
    * WHEN prompted for password criteria
    * THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
    * WHEN prompted for the length of the password
    * THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
    * WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
    * THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
    * WHEN I answer each prompt
    * THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
    * WHEN all prompts are answered
    * THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
    * WHEN the password is generated
    * THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

<h2>What I Did</h2>

<p>With this homework assignment, I was already given the html file and CSS file. I mainly had to focus on
the javascript. However, in the html and CSS files, I made a few minor changes. For the html file, I added comments. For the CSS file, I added comments as well but I did also change the border radius of the 
"Generate Password" button to give it a square shape instead of a round shape to have it match with the 
rest of the generator layout. Then, in javascript, I wrote code to match all of the criteria that was asked.</p>

<p>First, when you go to the password generator, you will see the password generator</p>
